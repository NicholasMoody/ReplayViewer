# ReplayViewer
Allows users to view Etterna charts and their corresponding replay data side by side to analyze how they are specifically hitting patterns and what mistakes they are making. 


It may also eventually function as a horrid profile viewer as I'll have to parse the etterna.xml file to find where the replay data for any score is anyway. Also, making a
profile viewer is basically the only way to allow users to easily select what scores they want to view.
